Which gives you a glimpse of whats going on in the tech world. The Google+ Hangouts (tm) feature makes it easy for us to come together and talk live via video and voice, share roundtable discussions with viewers thru the hangout. Once a days hangout has completed we add the resulting video to our site via our YouTube channel.
<h2>The Tech Hangout</h2>
is able to provide on air tech reviews and invite tech personalities for interviews and general talk about the state of tech via our TechHangout 2.0 video podcast. Whether its related to Mac or PC, Phones, cameras, musical instruments, Gaming gear, Movies, Cars and more. We meet every Tuesday at 5pm eastern. You can watch us live via our live YouTube channel, join us for discussion or catch up with the weeks show by visiting our site. However tech affects you whether its Mac or PC, Phones, games, gaming Consoles, tablets, internet gadgets cameras musical gear, we are sure to cover it at some point. The Tech Hangout, tech made real by real people.

In 2015, we also introduced an editorial arm with news, reviews, and editorials.  This allows our collaborators to go more in depth on issues than we can on a 1hr (ish) Podcast.

<h2>Google +</h2>
If you are new to Google + all you need to do is head over to <a title="Google Plus" href="https://plus.google.com" target="_blank"><cite>https://<b>plus</b>.<b>google</b>.com</cite></a> and sign up. If you already have a gmail account, youtube account or use adwords or adsense you already have a google+ account and just need to add it to your google account. From there you can post images and videos and information on your life, your lifestyle or anything that catches your eye. The big thing about google plus is your circles. Adding your friends and family to different circles is easy and ensures information meant for one set of friends or "circle" isn't shared with others unless you want it public,
