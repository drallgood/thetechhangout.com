Harman, one of the leading audio companies in the world, has released a new and very interesting car receiver: The [JBL Legend CP100]().  The CP100 is built around a 6.75" Capacitive Touch screen and is compatible with both Apple's CarPlay and Android Auto.  Its powered by a iMX6 ARM CPU.  It doesn't have a CD or DVD player, but it has everything you'd expect in an entry level smartphone connected car stereo including USB inputs, bluetooth, a Mic, a rear camera jack, and steering wheel control input.  Its not anything that you wouldn't find on the Pioneer App Radio 4 or Alpine ILX-007, well, with the exception of Android Auto.

Where the CP100 excels is at price.  It's able to offer a competitive feature set at $399.  A full $200 less than the competition.  It makes having a connected stereo much more affordable.  We'll find out if this is as an amazing buy as it seems when it hits stores in a couple months.
