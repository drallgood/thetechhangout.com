Its time for the next evolution of the Tech Hangout.  As you all know, I've been doing some original content on My personal Blog <a href="http://www.BenRoethig.com" target="_blank">BenRoethig.com</a>.  Starting today, I will also be putting Tech News, Reviews, and Editorials up on TheTechHangout.com.

Since this is a fan-based site, you can contribute too.  There's absolutely no pay check involved since we're not a business and we don't runs ads.  Hell, we don't even pay ourselves.  You can have the opportunity to be a published tech writer or reviewer... even if nobody reads it.

If you would like to contribute, let us know.
