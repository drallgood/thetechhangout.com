I have to admit, with the invention of USB 3.1 Type-C, I wondered where Apple and the rest of the professional PC market was going to go. &nbsp;USB-C took a lot of Thunderbolt's advantages and put them into a connector that's not much better than a Micro-USB or Lightning connector. &nbsp;Intel made a lot of the ambiguity go away with today's announcement of <a href="http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2015/06/thunderbolt3/" target="_blank">Thunderbolt 3</a>. &nbsp;Its faster, more capable, and completely compatible with USB 3.1 Type-C. &nbsp;Apple's future got a lot clearer.

The Mini-DisplayPort connector used by Thunderbolt is tiny compared to even HDMI and USB Type-C makes it look like a pig. &nbsp;Thunderbolt had some advantages especially with professional customers since its direct to the PCI-E bus, but for consumers, the reversible connector of USB-C, 10Gbps data, DisplayPort and HDMI over a single cable, and gives you 100w of power. &nbsp;In other words it takes every great great about USB 3.1, doubles the speed, makes it smaller, and combines it with both your display cable and your power cable. &nbsp;USB-C is both more capable and more flexible. &nbsp;Because of this, sooner rather than later you'll see <a href="http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2015/06/thunderbolt3/" target="_blank">Thunderbolt 3</a> replace USB Type-A ports on computers, MicroUSB ports on phones and tablets, 12v power ports, and if I were a betting man even Apple's proprietary Lightning connector. &nbsp;It makes too much sense not to. &nbsp;As for Thunderbolt, it features a couple of features that USB-C does not such as a faster data rate and lower latency with its own dedicated chip and peer to peer communication.

<a href="http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2015/06/thunderbolt3/" target="_blank">Thunderbolt 3 </a>uses a combination of all of the advantages above and adds PCI-E 3.0 to the mix for up to 40Mbps of data bandwidth. &nbsp;That's double Thunderbolt 2 and Quadruple that of USB 3.1. &nbsp;Its fully backwards compatible with USB 3.1 Type-C devices and gives the same 100w of power for computers and up to 15w for bus powered accessories. &nbsp;It doesn't stop there. &nbsp;Thunderbolt has built-in 10gig-E ethernet in addition to the existing Thunderbolt peer to peer protocols. &nbsp;It has a full 8 DisplayPort lanes that can drive twin 4k displays at 60hz. &nbsp;It gets even better, while external graphics solutions were toyed about unofficially with Thunderbolt 1 &amp; 2, Thunderbolt 3 officially supports external graphics cards for giving your laptop a little more umph. &nbsp;This is especially huge if you have a laptop with Intel or AMD integrated graphics.

When will you see <a href="http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2015/06/thunderbolt3/" target="_blank">Thunderbolt 3</a> laptops, I expect later this year or early 2016. &nbsp;With the USB Type-C compatibility, &nbsp;there isn't a whole lot of reason not to add it to the next revision of desktops, desktop replacement laptops, and (mobile) workstations that already use Thunderbolt. &nbsp;For Apple, fully expect it to show up in the next revision of their computers. &nbsp;It could also make sense to move Thunderbolt more mainstream. &nbsp;PC gamers will appreciate the external graphics capability and people that don't want to use Thunderbolt just have another USB-C port on their computer. &nbsp;We have seen the future. &nbsp;USB-C is the future with Thunderbolt evolving to become a higher-end version of that standard. &nbsp;Its a commonsense solution that combined with much improved capabilities will benefit everyone. &nbsp;I, for one, am excited about the future.
