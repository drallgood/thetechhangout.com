<p>A few of you might already be aware, that there will be an Apple event today.
So, we'll all be busy drooling over the shiny new things Apple announced (at least a few of us will) and won't be able to do our weekly Hangout. </p>

<p>Instead, the show will be on friday at 4pm ET/1pm PT. Don't worry we'll still be talking about today's event, just in a more clear and well thought manner.</p>
