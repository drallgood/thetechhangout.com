Apple today updated two of its top of the line Macs, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac" target="_blank">5k iMac </a>and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro" target="_blank">15" MacBook Pro</a> with Retina Display. &nbsp;Both are relatively minor refreshes that tweak the already existing lines. 

## 5k iMac
The new iMac, which was launched in its 12" 5k incarnation last fall, comes in a much more affordable price. &nbsp;The initial model debuted at $2499 and today a new lower end version with a 3.3ghz Quad Core i5 CPU can be had at $500 less at $1999. &nbsp;It also comes with 8GB of memory and a 1TB hard drive as well the Radeon R9 M290 graphics. &nbsp;The original top of the line model receives a $200 price drop to $2299. &nbsp;That features a 3.5ghz Quad Core i5 CPU and R9 M290X graphics. &nbsp;If you were looking for other changes like USB Type-C, you'll have to wait for the next generation.

The 21.5" which was last refreshed in June of 2014 and Non-5K 27" iMac last touched in September of 2013 were not updated along with the 5k models.

## 15" Macbook Pro Retina
The 15" Retina MacBook Pro was also updated with some of the features found on the new MacBook and updated 13" model. &nbsp;The updated machines feature the new Force Touch trackpad, faster PCI-E x4 SSD drives, and new Radeon R9 M370X graphics chip in the higher end model. &nbsp;The battery has been tweaked to be slightly larger. &nbsp;This has the side effect of bumping the battery life from 8 hours to 9 hours.

What does not change are the CPUs. &nbsp;While the new 13" has 5th generation dual core Broadwell chips, the 15" retains 4th generation Quad Cores at 2.2, 2.5ghz, and 2.8ghz. &nbsp;These are the exact same chips as the 15" updates launched 10 months ago. &nbsp;Apple isn't alone. &nbsp;Intel hasn't shipped 5th generation Quad Cores to anyone yet. &nbsp;Since the Intel graphics are on-die, it also retains the Iris 5200 Pro integrated graphics.

General configurations and the $1999 and $2499 price points remained unchanged from last year.
