Grade: Incomplete.


That they're both in beta and will likely change making any attempt to review them at this time moot.  Further more, the quality of user experience isn't up to what you'd expect in a finished product with features and apps buggy because the code isn't finished yet.  If this sounds like we're trolling all the other sites who live off of them, damn right we are.  Also, unless you're a developer or a tech journalist willing to take the risks of buggy prerelease software that may void you Apple warrant, just leave the betas alone and wait until the finished product.

**Oh yeah, did I mention to just say no to pre-release software?**
