Its been a good summer for Hulu.  First they inked a deal with CBS to integrate Showtime into Hulu with a discount.  Then earlier this week, they inked a massive multi-year <a href="http://blog.hulu.com/2015/08/30/hulu-and-epix-announce-extensive-multi-year-agreement/">content deal</a> with EPIX, just as Netflix's deal with them expired.  They're not done yet.  Hulu is putting the capper on their summer with an [announcement](http://blog.hulu.com/2015/09/02/hulu-adds-commercial-free-viewing/) that for an additional $4, $11.99 a month, you can get their content add-free.  So if ads in your first-run network content annoy you, you can now pay a bit more to watch it advertisement free.

Hulu is also dipping its toes in more credible original programming including 11/22/63 a collaboration between Stephen King and JJ-Abrams and starring James Franco, Difficult people from Amy Poehler, and a few more.  Its also picking up the Mindy Project which was cancelled by Fox.

The streaming wars are heating up and this can only be a good thing for consumers.
