We've taken this week off to retool for the launch of the new show format next week.  We did this for a couple reasons.  First, Its very apparent that my ISP wasn't going to cut it anymore.  I'll have my new ISP next week with much better bandwidth.  I also wanted to discuss the Apple watch in the more formal setting of the new show.  We'll see you next week on the new and better Tech Hangout
