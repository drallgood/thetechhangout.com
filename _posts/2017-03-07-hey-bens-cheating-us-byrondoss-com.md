<p>Just kidding!  I wrote a review of the iHome iPLWBT5 at a new site called <a href="http://www.byrondoss.com">ByronDoss.com</a> and hope to be doing some more reviews there soon.  The site is followed by a lot of the old Geek Beat fans from before the split.  Its definitely the beginning here and I'm hoping for good things in the future.  Also, this iHome is a really good option if you want something that will charge both your iPhone and Apple Watch and it has some really good sound for such a little thing.

What this means for The Tech Hangout?  Nothing.  I will continue to write editorial content here.  But definitely give Byron's site a look.  He has some great giveaways from time to time for those in his community.</p>
