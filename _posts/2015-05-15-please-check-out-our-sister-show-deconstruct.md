As we've said many times on the Tech Hangout and Tech Hangout 2.0, Patrice and I have another show called Deconstruct also featuring Jerry who you haven't met on the hangout.  If you're looking for an uplifting and family friendly show, Deconstruct isn't it.  Deconstruct is an audio-only not safe for work tech satire that calls out articles for bad practices and inaccurate information.  If you want to check it out, you can go to <a href="http://Deconstruct.TV">Deconstruct.TV</a> or click on the click ling in the Deconstruct Menu.  You can also support our sister show throw its <a href="http://www.payusbitches.com">Patreon Page</a>.
