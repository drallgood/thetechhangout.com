I've tried every single iOS client for iOS and for some reason I've decided for various reasons I've disliked something about them all except Apple mail enough where I stopped using them. &nbsp;As someone with a few lingering quirks from OCD, I can be very picky when it comes to apps. &nbsp;This is doubly so with email and RSS reader apps. &nbsp;The newest email client is one I've ended up absolutely loving, <a href="https://readdle.com/products/spark" target="_blank">Spark</a> from iOS developer <a href="http://www.readdle.com/" target="_blank">Readdle</a>.

Spark features a really powerful smart mailbox with commonsense groups. &nbsp;It tries to group emails into 5 different categories: New emails - emails you want to see most, Notifications, &nbsp;Newsletters, pinned emails, and your overall inbox. &nbsp;Each one of these categories can be viewed 3 different ways: a unified email box with all your accounts funneled in, grouped emails for each inbox, or each inbox separately. &nbsp;You can choose to customize your preference for each one. &nbsp;So you can have all your important mail grouped by individual inbox and all the store emails you get lumped together. &nbsp;Its smart enough to know that you're probably going to want to be looking at a job site's email rather than put it in the newsletter section. &nbsp;Email actions in your inboxes is based on half or full swipes so getting through unwanted emails, pinning them, or archiving &nbsp;is quick and ready. &nbsp;Spark also gives you access to the full mailboxes of all included email accounts. &nbsp;The search is powerful is has natural langue support.

What really makes Spark special is the customization and integration with other services. &nbsp;Its highly compatible with Google Gmail, MS Exchange, MS Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, and quickly and easily sets up any custom email servers. &nbsp;Same story with cloud services. &nbsp;You get Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, MS OneDrive, Evernote, OneNote, Readability, Pocket, and Instapaper. &nbsp;The client is compatible with 1Password and LastPass extensions which makes signing in to these services very easy. &nbsp;Most of the interface is customizable as well. &nbsp;You can rearrange the top and bottom sections, add new categories, change what the swipes do and add widgets. &nbsp;The only real widget available is currently for the calendar, but there's quite a few more coming soon like access to your Apple and Amazon accounts, flight information, packing tracking, weather, and even statistics information. &nbsp;Spark has the potential to become a lot better than it is and its already the best email client I have ever used. &nbsp;Readdle left no stones uncovered. &nbsp;Yes, there's even an Apple watch companion app.

When it comes to flaws, I'm hard pressed to find them. &nbsp;It functions exactly how my work flow wants an email client to be. &nbsp;If there's an achilles heal at this point its that the apps is iPhone only at that stage. &nbsp;If you're on a iPad and you don't want to run an iPhone app, you're out of luck. &nbsp;given Readdle's history though, I would expect a universal version to come eventually.

Readdle's apps usually trend towards the $3-10 range range and I would have gladly paid that price in a heartbeat. &nbsp;Readdle had other ideas and is offering it totally for free. &nbsp;For $10 it would have been a bargain for its functionality, free there is no reason not to download Spark. &nbsp;Like all iOS apps you can grab it exclusively from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-fast-smart-email-for/id997102246?mt=8" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>.

It does't happen very often, but Spark is an app I can full get behind. &nbsp;Its what an email app should be. &nbsp;Its feature packed, customizable, fast, and you can't beat the price. &nbsp;It also makes you more productive. &nbsp;What are you waiting for, go download it now!
