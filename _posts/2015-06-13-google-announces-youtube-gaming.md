Something big happened while I was traveling the last few days. &nbsp;Google is now in direct competition with Amazon's <a href="http://www.twitch.com/" target="_blank">Twitch</a>&nbsp;having now announced&nbsp;<a href="https://gaming.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube Gaming</a>. &nbsp;Let's take a look.

I will admit it, even as a former hardcore gamer, I don't get watching other people game. &nbsp;It could be a generational thing, because a lot of people do. &nbsp;A well known Twitch stream has the following of a Yankees vs Red Sox Game. &nbsp;Game streaming is huge. &nbsp;It huge that not only did Twitch's former owners shutdown the Justin.TV streaming service to devote time to it, Apple announced a system level iOS API just for game replays at the recent WWDC 2015. &nbsp;For the hardcore geek community, professional gamers have become the athletes.

There is quite a bit of gaming content already on YouTube, but Google wants a more formal piece of the pie. &nbsp;Their YouTube division was heavily rumored to be in on Twitch before eventually losing to Amazon. &nbsp;It will have a dedicated app and a special website distinct from the rest of YouTube. &nbsp;You'll be able to subscribe to specific publishers and games and receive stream notifications. &nbsp;For gamers, Google will offer an easy solution to stream your gameplay without going through the entire live stream process. &nbsp;They're also offering all of YouTube's technology including 60fps streaming. 

According to the website, YouTube gaming will launch later on during the summer. &nbsp;They'll have a booth at the E3 gaming convention to show off their new product. &nbsp;This could be very big for Google and very big for online gaming.
