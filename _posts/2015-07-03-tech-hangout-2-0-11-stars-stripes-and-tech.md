### [Scientists Create Way to Make Better, Safe Lithium Batteries](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/18/safer-lithium-batteries-stanford/)
- Scientists have found a way to make a better Lithium batter
- Lithium batteries have had issues in the past, both in consumer devices and more famously on the 787 Dreamliner
- Shorts and battery fires are caused by formation of lithium growths called Dendrites
- Dendrites will pierce into the cathode layer of the battery and start a chain reaction.
- new formula adds a mixture of lithium polysulfide and lithium nitrate.
- leads to safe flat growths on the top of the lithium anode instead of dendrites
- mixture also adds longevity to the battery
- test batteries retained 99% of capacity through 300 cycles
- other batteries were less efficient after 150 cycles
- Discovery made my team at DoE’s SLAC lab 
- could be combined with other improvements to lithium for longer lasting batteries
