I'm not going to lie, the rollout of mobile car connectivity platforms Apple Carplay and Android Auto have been slower than I expected.  They've been given a major shot in the arm for 2016 as the [Ford Motor Company](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/01/04/sync-apple-carplay-android-auto.html?utm_source=loopinsight.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Feed%253A+loopinsight%252FKqJb+(The+Loop)&utm_content=FeedBurner) and [Fiat Chrysler Automobiles](http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=17210&mid=1) have both announced support for both platforms as part of their in-car entertainment systems.  Both automakers had been long-term holdouts to the platforms.  Let's take a look at the details starting with Ford.

Ford's implementation of Carplay and Android Auto will be part of their new QNX-based Sync 3 ecosystem.  It will come standard on the 2017 version of Sync 3 with an update to 2016 MY vehicles coming later during 2016.  Ford will take full advantage of Carplay enhancements in iOS 9 with not only touch control, but the vehicle's physical buttons able to control the Carplay interface.  The platforms are joined by additions to Ford's own AppLink platform including a AAA app and in-car LTE internet support.

Not very long after Ford's announcement, Fiat Chrysler announced its fourth generation of its Uconnect system.  The new Uconnect will feature a 8.4-inch touch screen and also have Carplay and Android Auto support.  The system will be available in the company's Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, and Ram vehicles.  Unlike rival Ford, FCA did not announce an upgrade path for older vehicles. They did, however, announce a special 12.1" version of the Uconnect for first responders.  The extra large version will be available on the Dodge Charger Pursuit police package and feature a resolution of 1024x768 compared to the 640x480 resolution of the 8.4" version.

With Ford and FCA, almost every automaker will have both Carplay and Android Auto in their 2017 model year lineups.
